# Advent of Code 2024

Attempting the Advent of Code 2024!
This year I'll be coding each day's puzzle in a different programming language!

I won't be using any AI-generated code, but I will be using the internet to look up syntax and libraries for the languages I'm not familiar with.

## Puzzles

- [Day 1](day1/): Python
- [Day 2](day2/): JavaScript
